**How to detect 'toxic' comments using Machine Learning techniques**

Metrics and limitations
Let's assume the program could make a mistake in 1 out of 20 cases 

**Metrics used:**
1. Recall
Bad comments ratio
If equal to 1, all bad comments were found

2. Precision
Probability of a found bad comment to be bad We don't want it to be lower than 0.95

**Goals:**
1. Develop a Binary classificator (input = comment(text); output = ) 
2. 2. Maximize Recall
3. Precision >= 0.95


**Dataset Composition**
Dataset used:
Russian Language Toxic Comments https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blackmoon/russian-language-toxic-comments?resource=download
